                <h2>What is FDM Printing?</h2>
                <p>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common and accessible 3D printing technology. It works by heating and extruding <strong>thermoplastic filament</strong>, which is deposited layer by layer onto a build platform to construct a physical object from the ground up. The process is precise but requires careful calibration to ensure successful prints.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Slicer Software</h2>
                <p>Before your printer can move, you need a <strong>Slicer</strong>. This software (like Cura or PrusaSlicer) takes a digital 3D model (usually an STL file) and "slices" it into hundreds or thousands of <strong>layers</strong>. It generates the machine code (<strong>G-Code</strong>) that tells your printer exactly where, when, and how fast to move the extruder and the print bed. Learning your slicer is the first, most critical step.</p>

                <h2>The Importance of Bed Leveling</h2>
                <p>For a successful print, the distance between the <strong>nozzle</strong> and the <strong>print bed</strong> must be consistent across the entire bed. This process is called <strong>bed leveling</strong>. If the nozzle is too close, it scrapes; if it's too far, the plastic won't adhere—resulting in print failure. Always check your leveling before a major print!</p>

                <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Layer Height:</strong> The thickness of each layer, measured in millimeters (e.g., 0.2mm). Thinner layers mean better detail but longer print times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infill:</strong> The internal structure of the model, usually a grid or honeycomb pattern, measured in percentage (e.g., 20%). Affects strength and material usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retraction:</strong> The printer temporarily pulling the filament backward to prevent oozing when the nozzle moves between non-printing areas.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Essential Calibration: E-Steps</h2>
                <p>The E-Steps (Extruder Steps per Millimeter) tell your printer how much motor rotation is needed to push exactly 10mm of filament. If your E-Steps are incorrect, you will experience either <strong>under-extrusion</strong> (gaps in layers) or <strong>over-extrusion</strong> (blobs and excessive material). Calibrating your E-Steps is crucial for achieving accurate dimensions and strong layers.</p>

                <h2>Solving Adhesion Issues</h2>
                <p>The first layer must stick firmly to the bed. Common adhesion solutions include: <strong>cleaning the bed</strong> thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol; using a thin layer of <strong>PVA glue stick</strong> for standard filaments like PLA; or applying a specialty spray for materials that tend to warp, such as ABS. A warped first layer, or "lifting," is a common sign of poor adhesion or uneven heating.</p>
